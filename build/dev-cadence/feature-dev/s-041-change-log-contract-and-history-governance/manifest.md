## Stage Status

| Stage | Status | Artifact | User Confirmation | Checkpoint Commit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Requirements Confirmation | ✅ `confirmed` | [需求确认](01-requirements.md) (`build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-041-change-log-contract-and-history-governance/01-requirements.md`) | `confirmed: user selected option 1 on 2026-07-19T12:02:17+08:00` | `ae6a932f18f452ec6e14f70170807700d50b1369` | Card Version 3 confirmed; user delegated uninterrupted continuation through System Testing. |
| Technical Solution | ✅ `confirmed` | [技术方案](02-technical-solution.md) (`build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-041-change-log-contract-and-history-governance/02-technical-solution.md`) | `confirmed: delegated by user on 2026-07-19T12:02:17+08:00` | `78a87b7219a4e5d5b6d5b0892c4133bc865d398d` | Supporting contract, owner-specific rules, explicit history migration, and dual freshness identity selected. |
| Implementation Plan | ✅ `confirmed` | [实施计划](03-implementation-plan.md) (`build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-041-change-log-contract-and-history-governance/03-implementation-plan.md`) | `confirmed: delegated by user on 2026-07-19T12:02:17+08:00` | `127cc6c543923ef31d5794094484a60346510186` | Four TDD tasks selected for Subagent-Driven Development. |
| Development Implementation | ✅ `completed` | [实施计划](03-implementation-plan.md) (`build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-041-change-log-contract-and-history-governance/03-implementation-plan.md`) | `delegated continuation confirmed on 2026-07-19T12:02:17+08:00` | `2500a5cfc1f5658b927c80b5e140bbdf8c3ee0a7` | Tasks 1-4 completed with per-task RED/GREEN evidence and independent task reviews. Main sync was then merged as `6b6c2d7`; final system tests run on that merge commit. |
| System Testing | ✅ `completed` | [系统测试报告](04-system-test-report.md) (`build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-041-change-log-contract-and-history-governance/04-system-test-report.md`) | `not applicable` | `d47bbc62d102f1fe39d7b483fb1444c99e7e751e` | All focused and full contract checks passed after main synchronization; final whole-branch review found no findings. |
| Business Acceptance | ✅ `accepted` | [业务验收](05-business-acceptance.md) (`build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-041-change-log-contract-and-history-governance/05-business-acceptance.md`) | `Accept: user confirmed on 2026-07-19T14:32:19+0800` | `ccc3b65c56af9bdfc98c929d671e2a9fe5cb65e3` | Accepted with no residual risk identified. Final integration merged locally to `main`. |

## Lifecycle Writeback

- Card status: `Done`
- Backlog source: `docs/backlog.md` section `待处理`
- Backlog destination: `docs/backlog.md` section `已完成`
- Derived parallel-view projection: removed; `main` no longer maintains a Backlog parallel work table.
- Ordering decision: user explicitly directed S-041 to move to `In Progress` without reordering the remaining pending rows; `Ordering Version` and `Ordering Change Log` were preserved.
- Delivery result/reference: local merge commit `952b4fa`

## Verification Summary

- Baseline verification: `bash scripts/check-all.sh` passed at `63453f377e80cf9c58b8bd56b299df7b6d9a6ac8`.
- Verification decision: `passed`
- Residual risks: none identified by system testing or final whole-branch review.
- Business acceptance decision: `Accept`
- Final integration decision: `merge locally to main`

## Design Freshness

- Evaluated at: `2026-07-19T12:26:02+0800`
- Card snapshot: `docs/stories/S-041-change-log-contract-and-history-governance.md`, Version `3`, Status `In Progress`.
- Requirements checkpoint: `ae6a932f18f452ec6e14f70170807700d50b1369`; confirmed scope and decisions remain current.
- Technical Solution checkpoint: `78a87b7219a4e5d5b6d5b0892c4133bc865d398d`; selected architecture remains compatible with the repository.
- Implementation Plan checkpoint: `127cc6c543923ef31d5794094484a60346510186`; the checkpoint tree contains `03-implementation-plan.md`.
- Execution context: branch `codex/s-041-change-log-governance-v2` in `.worktrees/s-041-change-log-governance-v2`; base `63453f377e80cf9c58b8bd56b299df7b6d9a6ac8`.
- Dependency state: no external dependency or unresolved design question blocks implementation.
- Material changes since confirmation: only this run's scoped stage records and checkpoint bindings; no product or contract dependency changed.
- Main synchronization update: user requested the `main` parallel-work-table removal on `2026-07-19`; merged `main` through `6b6c2d7` while preserving the S-041 migrated card history and `0.26.0` release. Ordering atomicity was reduced from four parts to the remaining authoritative `待处理`, `Ordering Version`, and `Ordering Change Log`.
- Status: `passed`; final integration completed locally and the card was synchronized to `Done`.
