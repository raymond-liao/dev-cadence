## Stage Table

| Stage | Status | Artifact | User Confirmation | Checkpoint Commit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Requirements Confirmation | ✅ `confirmed` | [S017 需求确认](01-requirements.md); `build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-017-work-item-development-workflow-integration/01-requirements.md` | delegated by user | `14e148e` | S017 Version 5 and the execution-only status transition are confirmed. |
| Technical Solution | ✅ `confirmed` | [S017 技术方案](02-technical-solution.md); `build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-017-work-item-development-workflow-integration/02-technical-solution.md` | delegated by user | `14e148e` | Pragmatic-balance design selected under the user's no-intermediate-confirmation delegation. |
| Implementation Plan | ✅ `confirmed` | [S017 实施计划](03-implementation-plan.md); `build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-017-work-item-development-workflow-integration/03-implementation-plan.md` | delegated by user | `14e148e` | TDD contract-first plan selected; implementation completed. |
| Development Implementation | ✅ `confirmed` | [S017 实施记录](04-implementation-record.md); `build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-017-work-item-development-workflow-integration/04-implementation-record.md` | delegated by user | `14e148e` | Final implementation SHA `ed2a07e`; final review passed. |
| System Testing | ✅ `confirmed` | [S017 系统测试报告](05-system-test-report.md); `build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-017-work-item-development-workflow-integration/05-system-test-report.md` | delegated by user | `14e148e` | `bash scripts/check-all.sh` passed; all nine criteria covered. |
| Business Acceptance | ✅ `confirmed` | [S017 业务验收记录](06-business-acceptance-record.md); `build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-017-work-item-development-workflow-integration/06-business-acceptance-record.md` | delegated by user | `14e148e` | Business Acceptance decision is `accepted`; explicit residual risk that Completion integration remains pending. |

## Work Item Identity

- Card: `docs/stories/S-017-work-item-development-workflow-integration.md`
- Card Version At Claim: `5`
- Card Status At Claim: `In Progress`
- Backlog Projection: `docs/backlog.md`, `进行中`, Version `5`, Status `In Progress`
- Claim Checkpoint: `f71b7f0`
- Status-Version Correction Checkpoint: `8315c1e`
- Main Checkout Projection Checkpoint: `fe19bf5`

## Baseline

- Baseline Commit: `8315c1e0e5bb6df037cd3865618fe5303da391ba`
- Baseline Verification: `bash scripts/build.sh && bash tests/run-all.sh` passed.

## Pre-Implementation Freshness Gate

- Card identity: `docs/stories/S-017-work-item-development-workflow-integration.md`, Version `5`, Status `In Progress`.
- Confirmed requirements: `01-requirements.md`, delegated confirmation, Version `5`.
- Confirmed technical solution: `02-technical-solution.md`, pragmatic-balance approach.
- Confirmed implementation plan: `03-implementation-plan.md`, Tasks 1-3.
- Current code identity: branch `codex/s-017-work-item-development-workflow-integration`, commit `8315c1e0e5bb6df037cd3865618fe5303da391ba`.
- Dependency state: S015, S016, and S037 are `Done`; S017 is `In Progress` in both the card and `docs/backlog.md`.
- Conclusion: ✅ `valid`; no requirement, solution, plan, dependency, or material repository change invalidates the confirmed implementation context.

## Verification Summary

- ✅ `passed`: `bash scripts/check-all.sh` passed after final implementation review.

## Residual Risks

- The implementation branch is not merged or pushed; Completion integration remains pending an explicit user choice.

## Business Acceptance Decision

- Decision: ✅ `accepted`
- Decision By: delegated user instruction on `2026-07-18`.
- Accepted Residual Risks: branch/worktree remains isolated and S017 remains `In Progress` until Completion integration.

## Final Integration Decision

- Decision: ⏳ `pending`
- No merge, pull request, push, branch deletion, or worktree deletion was performed.

## Final Implementation Identity

- Final Implementation SHA: `ed2a07ed1feb580a32bf09cd3bc4136df060e8d4`
