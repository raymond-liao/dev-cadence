## Stage Table

| Stage | Status | Artifact | User confirmation | Checkpoint commit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Requirements Confirmation | ✅ `confirmed` | `build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-006-discovery-content-boundary/01-requirements.md` | Confirmed by the 2026-07-14 batch execution instruction | `skipped: no tracked changes` | S-006 Version 1 was Ready and had no open questions. |
| Technical Solution | ✅ `confirmed` | `build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-006-discovery-content-boundary/02-technical-solution.md` | Delegated by the 2026-07-14 batch execution instruction | `skipped: no tracked changes` | Minimal extension of the existing Discovery contract selected. |
| Implementation Plan | ✅ `confirmed` | `build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-006-discovery-content-boundary/03-implementation-plan.md` | Delegated by the 2026-07-14 batch execution instruction | `skipped: no tracked changes` | Worktree verified; freshness gate passed. |
| Development Implementation | ✅ `confirmed` | `build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-006-discovery-content-boundary/04-implementation-record.md` | Delegated by the 2026-07-14 batch execution instruction | `fdda960b6bb2ff61f3b98cd5a3bca765297290f1` | TDD RED/GREEN complete; exact commit identity verified; code review passed. |
| System Testing | ✅ `confirmed` | `build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-006-discovery-content-boundary/05-system-test-report.md` | Delegated by the 2026-07-14 batch execution instruction | `skipped: no tracked changes` | Verification decision 🟢 `ready`; 11/11 acceptance criteria covered. |
| Business Acceptance | ✅ `confirmed` | `build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-006-discovery-content-boundary/06-business-acceptance-record.md` | Delegated by the 2026-07-14 batch execution instruction | `skipped: no tracked changes` | Decision ✅ `accepted`; branch retained for parent-task integration. |

## Design Freshness Gate

- Work item: `docs/stories/S-006-discovery-product-technical-content-boundary.md`, Version 1, Status Ready.
- Confirmed requirement: `01-requirements.md`.
- Confirmed solution: `02-technical-solution.md`.
- Implementation plan: `03-implementation-plan.md`.
- Branch and base commit: `codex/s-006-discovery-content-boundary` at `37e86d5bb2bccd69510251a9f48f61e2601a08b9`.
- Dependency state: S-005 is Done; its shared Registry skill and contracts are present.
- Conclusion: inputs remain valid; implementation may proceed without reconfirmation.

## Verification Summary

- Implementation commit: `fdda960b6bb2ff61f3b98cd5a3bca765297290f1`.
- Code review: ✅ `passed`; Critical 0, Important 0, Minor 0.
- System testing: 🟢 `ready`; full repository checks passed and all 11 acceptance criteria are covered.

## Residual Risks

- Semantic content compliance is enforced through workflow rules and contract assertions rather than a generated-document parser; this matches the repository architecture.

## Business Acceptance Decision

- Decision: ✅ `accepted`.
- Record: `build/dev-cadence/feature-dev/s-006-discovery-content-boundary/06-business-acceptance-record.md`.

## Final Integration Decision

- Integration action: keep `codex/s-006-discovery-content-boundary` for parent-task integration.
- No push or pull request was performed.
- Worktree cleanup result: `preserved`.
- Preservation reason: the parent batch task still needs the dedicated worktree and branch for integration and cross-card verification.
