# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Detect environment → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests

**Before presenting options, verify tests pass:**

```bash
# Run project's test suite
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:**
```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]

Cannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.
```

Stop. Don't proceed to Step 2.

**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Detect Environment

**Determine workspace state before presenting options:**

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
```

This determines which menu to show and how cleanup works:

| State | Menu | Cleanup |
|-------|------|---------|
| `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON` (normal repo) | Standard 4 options | No worktree to clean up |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, named branch | Standard 4 options | Provenance-based (see Step 6) |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, detached HEAD | Reduced 3 options (no merge) | No cleanup (externally managed) |

### Step 3: Determine and Freeze Merge Identity

For a normal checkout or named-branch worktree, determine the base branch before presenting Completion options. Prefer the local `main` branch; if it does not exist, use local `master`. If neither exists, stop and ask the user for the base branch. The merge-base result is ancestry evidence only; it must not replace the base branch name.

```bash
if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/main; then
  BASE_BRANCH=main
elif git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/master; then
  BASE_BRANCH=master
else
  printf 'Base branch not found; stop and ask the user.\n' >&2
  exit 1
fi

git merge-base HEAD "$BASE_BRANCH" >/dev/null
FEATURE_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
test -n "$FEATURE_BRANCH"
EXPECTED_FEATURE_SHA=$(git rev-parse "$FEATURE_BRANCH")
EXPECTED_BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse "$BASE_BRANCH")
```

Record the snapshot in the current Completion context:

```text
Base branch: <BASE_BRANCH>
Base SHA: <EXPECTED_BASE_SHA>
Feature branch: <FEATURE_BRANCH>
Feature SHA: <EXPECTED_FEATURE_SHA>
```

If base selection, ancestry verification, branch identity, or SHA capture fails, stop before presenting or executing a local Merge. Any failure stops the flow before cleanup and completion reporting. The branch is preserved on identity mismatch.

### Step 4: Present Options

**Normal repo and named-branch worktree — present exactly these 4 options:**

```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?
```

**Detached HEAD — present exactly these 3 options:**

```
Implementation complete. You're on a detached HEAD (externally managed workspace).

1. Push as new branch and create a Pull Request
2. Keep as-is (I'll handle it later)
3. Discard this work

Which option?
```

**Don't add explanation** - keep options concise.

### Step 5: Execute Choice

#### Option 1: Merge Locally

```bash
# Get main repo root for CWD safety
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"

# Revalidate the immutable Merge snapshot before changing checkout state.
test "$(git rev-parse "$FEATURE_BRANCH")" = "$EXPECTED_FEATURE_SHA"
test "$(git rev-parse "$BASE_BRANCH")" = "$EXPECTED_BASE_SHA"
test -z "$(git status --short --untracked-files=all)"

git checkout "$BASE_BRANCH"
test -z "$(git status --short --untracked-files=all)"

# This is a local-only Merge. Do not call git pull or git fetch here.
if git merge-base --is-ancestor "$EXPECTED_FEATURE_SHA" "$BASE_BRANCH"; then
  MERGE_RESULT=already-integrated
else
  git merge "$EXPECTED_FEATURE_SHA"
  MERGE_RESULT=merged
fi

# Verify the exact approved commit is in the target before cleanup.
git merge-base --is-ancestor "$EXPECTED_FEATURE_SHA" "$BASE_BRANCH"
FINAL_BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse "$BASE_BRANCH")
test -z "$(git status --short --untracked-files=all)"

# Verify tests on merged result
<test command>

# A failed command, conflict, or verification check stops here and preserves
# the branch/worktree. Recheck identity before any branch deletion.
test "$(git rev-parse "$FEATURE_BRANCH")" = "$EXPECTED_FEATURE_SHA"

# Only after merge succeeds: cleanup worktree (Step 6), then delete branch
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 6), then delete branch:

```bash
git branch -d "$FEATURE_BRANCH"
```

#### Option 2: Push and Create PR

```bash
# Push branch
git push -u origin <feature-branch>
```

**Do NOT clean up worktree** — user needs it alive to iterate on PR feedback.

#### Option 3: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>."

**Don't cleanup worktree.**

#### Option 4: Discard

**Confirm first:**
```
This will permanently delete:
- Branch <name>
- All commits: <commit-list>
- Worktree at <path>

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

Wait for exact confirmation.

If confirmed:
```bash
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 6), then force-delete branch:
```bash
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

### Step 6: Cleanup Workspace

**Only runs for Options 1 and 4.** Options 2 and 3 always preserve the worktree.

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
WORKTREE_PATH=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

**If `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON`:** Normal repo, no worktree to clean up. Done.

**If worktree path is under `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/`:** Superpowers created this worktree — we own cleanup.

```bash
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH"
git worktree prune  # Self-healing: clean up any stale registrations
```

**Otherwise:** The host environment (harness) owns this workspace. Do NOT remove it. If your platform provides a workspace-exit tool, use it. Otherwise, leave the workspace in place.

## Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Merge locally | yes | - | - | yes |
| 2. Create PR | - | yes | yes | - |
| 3. Keep as-is | - | - | yes | - |
| 4. Discard | - | - | - | yes (force) |

## Common Mistakes

**Skipping test verification**
- **Problem:** Merge broken code, create failing PR
- **Fix:** Always verify tests before offering options

**Open-ended questions**
- **Problem:** "What should I do next?" is ambiguous
- **Fix:** Present exactly 4 structured options (or 3 for detached HEAD)

**Cleaning up worktree for Option 2**
- **Problem:** Remove worktree user needs for PR iteration
- **Fix:** Only cleanup for Options 1 and 4

**Deleting branch before removing worktree**
- **Problem:** `git branch -d` fails because worktree still references the branch
- **Fix:** Merge first, remove worktree, then delete branch

**Running git worktree remove from inside the worktree**
- **Problem:** Command fails silently when CWD is inside the worktree being removed
- **Fix:** Always `cd` to main repo root before `git worktree remove`

**Cleaning up harness-owned worktrees**
- **Problem:** Removing a worktree the harness created causes phantom state
- **Fix:** Only clean up worktrees under `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/`

**No confirmation for discard**
- **Problem:** Accidentally delete work
- **Fix:** Require typed "discard" confirmation

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request
- Remove a worktree before confirming merge success
- Clean up worktrees you didn't create (provenance check)
- Run `git worktree remove` from inside the worktree

**Always:**
- Verify tests before offering options
- Detect environment before presenting menu
- Present exactly 4 options (or 3 for detached HEAD)
- Get typed confirmation for Option 4
- Clean up worktree for Options 1 & 4 only
- `cd` to main repo root before worktree removal
- Run `git worktree prune` after removal
